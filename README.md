Module 15 leaflet Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called leaflet-challenge which contains a HTML file called index, which contains the code for the earthquake webpage. There is also a folder called static that contains 2 folders, one called css which has a css file called style which styles the webpage and a js foder which contains a javascript file called logic which contains all the code needed to create the worldmap visualisation with markers that correspond to earthquake locations and properties.The Javascript and HTML codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. The Data for the earthquakes was collected from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson. To add myh legend I adapted code from https://www.javatpoint.com/html-legend-tag#:~:text=HTML%20tag%20is%20used,purpose%20of%20grouped%20form%20elements.To select the colours I went to https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp.
